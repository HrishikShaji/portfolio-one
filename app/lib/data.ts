			"My name is Hrishik Shaji.I'm 23 years old.I'm from Thrissur,Kerala,India.I'm a son,a brother and a good friend for a handful of people.After 10th, i took computer science for plus two because i loved computers since i grew up playing computer games.As for my Degree i chose B.Sc Computer Science, unfortunately i failed some papers not the core subjects, but still i had to say goodbye to my degree.After leaving computers i tried jobs in other areas and had some success and some failures but nothing felt permanent.And then after few years i started learning programming, i attended a full stack Web development Bootcamp in Udemy, fortunately i completed it and it felt good to be back to the computer science.After that i have been teaching myself about programming, i learnt new languages and frameworks, implemented them in my projects and soon i was able to build working web apps, and i believe i am ready now to have a career in web development.For my future employers i only have this message: Each and Every Error that stood before me as an obstacle stands no more and i will remove them as long as i wish to.Also i am hardworking, willing to learn new technologies, exceptionally adaptive to all kinds of scenarios.",
